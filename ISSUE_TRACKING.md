# Issue Tracking

If you require **support** with the Web Services, please utilise our Slack channels for this purpose.  Issues regarding the features and functions of the Web Services or how to perform a specific task will not be handled.

This document sets out the workflow and processes involved in Issue Tracking for the Core Repository.

**We no longer use GitHub Issues for tracking**

## JIRA

Development tasks (new features, technical tasks, bugs, etc.) should now be tracked and actioned using JIRA. VATSIM UK's JIRA Installation is available at [vatsimuk.atlassian.net](https://vatsimuk.atlassian.net).

This project's issues are tracked within the [CORE project](https://vatsimuk.atlassian.net/projects/CORE/issues)

Anyone can view the issues currently within the project. But to create issues, you will need to [sign up for an account](https://vatsimuk.atlassian.net/login).

**Please Note:** If you want to actively work on issues and contribute to the project, you will need to speak to us so that we can grant you "contributor" permissions for the project. You will not be able to assign or work on issues until this has been done.

You can request this by:
* Commenting on an issue you would like to tackle
* Contacting us through Slack (a more robust service-desk style process is being worked on)

## Guidance

When submitting an issue, there's a few guidelines we'd ask you to respect to make it easier to manage (and for others to understand):

* **Search the issue tracker** before you submit your issue - it may already be present.
* When opening an issue, please provide as much information as necessary to ensure others are able to act upon the requests or bug report.
* We measure our tasks in **time**.  If your issue is likely to be a **large job** then speak to us (via Slack or Email) about making a milestone for it, and you can add multiple issues within one milestone.
* Please ensure you add screenshots or documentation references for bugs/changes so we can quickly ascertain if the request is suitable.
